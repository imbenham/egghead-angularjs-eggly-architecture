<div class="suggest-panel">
    <h3 class="suggest-panel-content">Have a new category idea? Let us know!</h3>
    <form>
        <p>I think <input type="text" class="suggest-content suggest-input" ng-model="suggestCtrl.suggested"/> would make a great bookmark category!
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" class="suggest-input" id="submit-button" ng-click="suggestCtrl.submitSuggested()"/></p>
    </form>
